#### TASK 1 - Minor UI changes
- The app shows a red ribbon on the appbar, it looks ugly, please remove it.
- Change the app bar name to `The Interview`

#### TASK 2 - List all users
- List all the users on the home screen (Mock data should be in `data/mock_data.dart`)
- We want to see the First name and last name as a title
- We want to see the role as description
- Show the user image on the left
- The user image should have a placeholder (in case there is no image), please add the package https://pub.dev/packages?q=font_awesome_flutter and use `FontAwesomeIcons.image`

#### TASK 3 - Refactoring & Bug Fixing
- We want the user avatar logic to be a widget, please refactor it in a new file `widgets/avatar`
- `Add user` button is not working, we want a new user to be added but when we press the + button it doesn't do anything
- Clean up the search controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree.

### TASK 4 - Features
- When the app starts the keyboard should show and focus on the search
- Add a search to filter that filters by user's first name, last name, role and email

### TASK 5 - Suggestions
